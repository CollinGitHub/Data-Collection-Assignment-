Makerere University is a huge university that boasts of a\hfill population of around 50,000 students. These students taking part is hundreds of tertiary education programs across the university. Some of the students reside on the campus but most reside outside the campus. Some come from home, others sleep in hostels, rentals and a few in halls located on campus. But these students all have one thing in common, they all study on the same campus.

\section*{OBJECTIVES}
1)	To set up and Open Data Kit Aggregate Server to upload the forms for data collection.

2)	To create forms using open data kit to use to collect the data from the eating places.

The opening times range between 6:00hrs to 11:00hrs while the closing times range from 18:00hrs to 23:00hrs. Then the duration of hours the eating places are open is between 9 to 17 hours.

It was found that the restaurants are many as compared to the canteens from the data collected. The graph below shows the percentage of restaurants and canteens on the Makerere University Campus according to the data collected.

 \section*{CONCLUSION}
 On the basis of the findings, I discovered that the number of restaurants exceeds the number of canteens. I also discovered that the opening times of canteens were much earlier as compared to the restaurants. And on the contrary the closing times were much later. This led to another conclusion that canteens are open for more hours as compared to restaurants and thus can provide food for much longer durations.
